# Notation

I will use $X$ to represent our data. This means $X$ is a matrix of shape $n \times p$ ($n$ samples and $p$ features).

| $i$ | Temperature | Humidity | Percipitation | Comfortable |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 12C         | 74%      | 3mm           | yes         |
| 1   | 24C         | 67%      | 0mm           | yes         |
| 2   | 4C          | 91%      | 13mm          | no          |
| $n$ | (...)       | (...)    | (...)         | (...)       |

Each row is a **sample** and each column a **feature**.

---

# Notation

I will use $y$ to represent our labels. This means $y$ is a vector with $n$
entries. One for each sample.

| $i$ | Comfortable? |
| --- | ------------ |
| 0 | yes          |
| 1 | yes          |
| 2 | no           |
| $n$ | (...)        |

For each sample we have one **label**.

---

# Notation

For regression we will use $y$ to represent our **targets**. This means $y$ is a vector with $n$ entries. One for each sample.

| $i$ | Sunshine minutes |
| --- | ------------ |
| 0 | 14          |
| 1 | 28          |
| 2 | 2           |
| $n$ | (...)        |

# Generalisation error

We are interested in how well the classifier performs on data from the future.

Split off a fraction of the dataset at the start, use it to simulate the future.

Training data:

| $i$ | Feature 1 | Feature 2 |
| --- | ----------- | -------- |
| 0   | 2.14         | 5.234     |
| 1   | 1.124        | 0.32      |
| 2   | -2.24       | 2.32      |
| 3   | -1.24        | 3.23      |

Testing data:

| $i$ | Feature 1 | Feature 2 |
| --- | ----------- | -------- |
| 4   | 5.34        | 6.34    |
| 5   | 2.24          | -5.23      |

# Cross-validation strategies

There are many strategies for splitting your data. Here a few.

You can find several more in the scikit-learn documentation:

# StratifiedKFold

Makes sure class fractions in the full dataset are correctly
represented in each split.

---

# GroupKFold

.center.width-90[![](images/group_kfold.png)]

All samples from the same group are always in the same split.

# Accuracy

What fraction of classes did the model predict correctly.

$$ \mathrm{Accuracy} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{TN}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{TN}+\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{FN}} $$

# Precision

How many selected items are relevant?

$$ \mathrm{Precision} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FP}} $$

# Recall

How many relevant items are selected?

$$ \mathrm{Recall} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FN}} $$

If your classes are (very) imbalanced then accuracy is not a good measure.

Tim's favourite baseline: the [`DummyClassifier`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).

# ROC Area Under Curve (ROC AUC)

Works well for unbalanced classes, shows you what trade offs you can make.

# Changing the threshold

By default scikit-learn classifiers assign classes based on the midpoint of
the possible classifier output (0.5). You can change this threshold to make
different trade-offs.

```
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

knn = KNeighborsClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

```
             precision    recall  f1-score   support

      False       0.86      0.86      0.86        51
       True       0.86      0.86      0.86        49

avg / total       0.86      0.86      0.86       100
